# Swagger generated server

Spring Boot Server 


## Overview

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

Start your server as an simple java application  

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost:8080/  

Change default port value in application.properties

## Performance Issues

Accessing a pool of internet beacons is challenging. Some work has been done in the code base (in various utility methods in the KnowledgeBeaconService class, etc.) to dynamically adjust timeouts for various API client calls, but there is likely more work to be done to decrease the latency of the aggregator through additional strategies: caching, intelligent pruning of API calls, turning off logging, etc.

Note that some of the timeouts experienced may be exterior to the application: sometimes the web server (e.g. NGINX proxies in production) need to have their Gateway timeouts adjusted. Your mileage may vary.
